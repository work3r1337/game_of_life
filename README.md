# Game of life
This repository contains the code for a simple `Game of life` game implemented in C. The game uses the "ncurses.h" library for graphics rendering and keyboard input.

## Introduction
This project is a classic `Game of life` implemented in C. The game uses the "ncurses.h" library to handle graphics rendering and keyboard input. The main objective of the game is to observe the evolution of a cellular automaton that develops according to simple rules and study the complex patterns that emerge

## Game Overview
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a mathematical simulation that models the life cycle of cells in a grid-based universe. Unlike traditional games, it has no players, no objectives, and no randomness-once started, it evolves purely based on its initial configuration and simple rules. The "game" is an endless dance of birth, survival, and death, producing mesmerizing and often unpredictable patterns

## Installation
To run the game, you need a C compiler that supports the "ncurses.h" library.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or simply download the .zip file.
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable to start the game.
4. Use the following controls to change speed of generation:
   - 'a' - Increase speed
   - 'z' - Decrease speed
   - 'space' - Quit the game
