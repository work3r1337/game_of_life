# Game of life
This repository contains the code for a simple `Game of life` game implemented in C. The game uses the "ncurses.h" library for graphics rendering and keyboard input.

## Introduction
This project is a classic `Game of life` implemented in C. The game uses the "ncurses.h" library to handle graphics rendering and keyboard input. The main objective of the game is ещ observe the evolution of a cellular automaton that develops according to simple rules and study the complex patterns that emerge

## Game Overview
Conway’s Game of Life is a mathematical simulation that models the life cycle of cells in a grid-based universe. Unlike traditional games, it has no players, no objectives, and no randomness—once started, it evolves purely based on its initial configuration and simple rules. The "game" is an endless dance of birth, survival, and death, producing mesmerizing and often unpredictable patterns

## Installation
To run the game, you need a C compiler that supports the "ncurses.h" library.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or simply download the .zip file.
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable to start the game.
4. Use the following controls to move Pacman:
   - 'a' - Increase speed
   - 'z' - Decrease speed
   - 'space' - Quit the game
